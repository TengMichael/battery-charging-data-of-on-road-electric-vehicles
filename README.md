Data set for paper "Prognostics of battery capacity based on charging data and data-driven methods for on-road vehicles".

The charging data of battery packs for 20 commercial electric vehicles are contributed to be publically avaiable. 
Each #x represents the data of a vehicle, and the time span of the data is over two years, around 29 months.

If you use this data set to do other researches, you need to cite this paper.
