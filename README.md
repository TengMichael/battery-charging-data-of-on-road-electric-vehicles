Data set for paper "Deng Z, Xu L, Liu H, Hu X, Duan Z, Xu Y. Prognostics of battery capacity based on charging data and data-driven methods for on-road vehicles. Applied Energy. 2023;339:120954".

The charging data of battery packs for 20 commercial electric vehicles are contributed to be publicly available. 
Each #x represents the data of a vehicle, and the time span of the data is over two years, around 29 months.

`The codes for capacity extraction and visualization have been uploaded.`

# battery pack information update
The vehicles are BAIC EU500, equipped with CATL NCM batteries. 
The nominal capacity is 145Ah, and there are 90 battery cells connected in series and 32 temperature sensors inside the pack.
